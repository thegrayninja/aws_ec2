# First, we'll start with Client API for Amazon S3. Let's instantiate a new
# client object. With no parameters or configuration, boto3 will look for
# access keys in these places:
#
#    1. Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
#    2. Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials or
#         C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\credentials)
#    3. AWS IAM role for Amazon EC2 instance
#       (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)
#os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'] = 'eu-west-2'
s3client = boto3.client('s3')

# # Everything uploaded to Amazon S3 must belong to a bucket. These buckets are
# # in the global namespace, and must have a unique name.
# #
# # For more information about bucket name restrictions, see:
# # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html

# os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'] = 'eu-west-2'
# myS3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# Using the client, you can generate a pre-signed URL that you can give
# others to securely share the object without making it publicly accessible.
# By default, the generated URL will expire and no longer function after one
# hour. You can change the expiration to be from 1 second to 604800 seconds
# (1 week).

# Buckets cannot be deleted unless they're empty. Let's keep using the
# Resource API to delete everything. Here, we'll utilize the collection
# 'objects' and its batch action 'delete'. Batch actions return a list
# of responses, because boto3 may have to take multiple actions iteratively to
# complete the action.
