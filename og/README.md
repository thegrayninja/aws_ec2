# aws_ec2
examples of commands as I learn aws cli

these files likely won't be of anything new, but rather things I find interesting with aws cli that I don't want to forget. 
the examples will contain aws cli dumping to json, as well as python importing json. I won't be uploading my .json, nor the output of python.
